# Sessions — living state

**The one document to read first.** Everything else is either a binding
authority (§4), a protocol for a specific experiment, or history. This file
is updated at every ceremony and whenever live use produces a finding; if it
disagrees with an older document about *current state*, this one wins.

_Last updated: 2026-08-18, after the session-management ship + live
two-machine testing._

## 1. What is live

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Deployed | `build/2026-08-18.3` (`70afd29a`) on lightyear since 12:12Z |
| Verified | kind probe: 44229 accepted, 44230 known — deploy confirmed from outside |
| Unshipped | `1cb7148c` (idle status + 4h idle-shutdown) on the wip branch |

Shipped in this arc: durable names (R26), closure/stop separation (R27),
verified rehydration + systemPrompt-first bootstrap, continuity disclosure
end to end, reconnect that follows its generation, visible turn refusals,
foreign-member authority resolution, project-claim inheritance on join,
operator attribution.

Proven live, not merely tested: the full authority ladder (observe → refuse →
grant → grantee turn → stop refused, 2026-08-18 local); cross-provider
rehydration on the deployed relay; operator attribution rendering correctly
across two machines simultaneously.

## 2. Open — ordered, each with its evidence

1. **Rehydration is create-only.** A reattached execution gets no context
   MCP (`session.rs` resume/load pass empty server lists; `lib.rs` reattach
   passes `rehydration_mcp: None`). Confirmed twice on 2026-08-18: a resumed
   Codex lost its package, and a later agent read Claude generation 2 saying
   it "did not see that tool available". Transport already supports it.
2. **The package is a start-time snapshot.** Provenance says
   `complete: true` meaning "complete when projected", which reads as
   "current". A joined execution never learns what a sibling did afterward
   (observed: Codex reported 16/16 complete while Claude had advanced to 6
   turns). Fix: time-bound the provenance, then add refresh.
3. **`session_history` page cap is 20** (`session_context.rs:23-24`). Reading
   101 items took six calls plus a hard `limit must be between 1 and 20`
   error. Untenable as sessions grow.
4. **Provenance has an unexplained delta.** `sourceEventCount` counts the
   proof graph (`1 + authority_links×2 + names + goals + per generation
   (3 + transcript)`, `context_projector.rs:945-955`), not content, so it
   exceeds `totalHistoryItems`. Nothing is missing, but the package never
   says so and a careful agent had to flag it as unexplained.
5. **Desktop grant-awareness (A8-shaped).** Granted operators still see a
   gated composer; every new session needs its members added by CLI, because
   each create stamps a fresh transport channel. The observation half needs
   no new protocol and is not blocked by A6.
6. **Stale clients are invisible.** An old client shows "ungoverned — adopt
   to govern", falls open, and silently swallows refusals. There is no
   version signal in the UI.
7. **P1 has never run.** Harness (`scripts/p1-seed-spike/`), judging protocol
   (`P1_JUDGE_SCRIPT.md`), and matrix (`P1_CONTINUITY_MATRIX.md`) are ready.
   Gates the whole seed/checkpoint track.
8. Smaller: stale-Reconnect echo port (`a92fd728` absent from this line);
   `rejectedAuthorCount` surfaced nowhere; `Loaded` vs `Resumed` conflated at
   the receipt layer.

### Recovered 2026-08-18 from superseded handoffs (verified still true)

These were tracked in documents that had been superseded and had fallen off
every live list. Each was re-verified against current source before landing
here.

9. **The agent inherits the operator's personal MCP servers.** The env fence
   scrubs the `BUZZ_*` namespace plus a few enumerated third-party secrets
   (`agent_fence.rs:52-60`) and says nothing about MCP configuration, so an
   adapter can reach an operator's personal Gmail/Calendar/browser servers.
   Env scrubbing cannot fix it. **This gates the collaboration release**
   (A6/A8): sharing a session must not share the founder's personal
   integrations. Originally SESSION_HANDOFF_SOL §7.3.
10. **Permission requests are auto-approved in the transport.**
    `session/request_permission` is answered `allow_once` inside the ACP read
    loop (`acp.rs:1445`, dispatch `:1520`). No operator ever sees a prompt.
    This is the root blocker for any approval story, and approvals appear
    nowhere in D1–D6. Prior art to reuse when it is picked up:
    a neutral runtime-mode vocabulary (`approval-required` /
    `auto-accept-edits` / `auto` / `full-access`) mapped per provider
    (SESSION_HANDOFF_SOL §6), and the architectural recommendation that
    session permission requests get their own signed kinds rather than
    reusing workflow kind 46010, while reusing Buzz's existing
    pending-decision / grant-deny / `needs_action` / push mechanics
    (SESSION_NATIVE_SUBSTRATE §1).
11. **A crashing adapter can never be classified auth-required.**
    `mentions_auth` inspects only `AgentError` message text
    (`session.rs:774`), so an adapter that exits *because it is not logged
    in* surfaces as generic `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` and the guided-login
    affordance never appears. Andy hit exactly this. Compounded by **adapter
    stderr being inherited, not captured** (`acp.rs:649`), so the one
    diagnostic naming the cause never reaches a log a user can send.
12. **Execution labels collide.** Every execution row is labelled by the
    provider pubkey, so same-provider executions render identically. Assigned
    to UI Slice 2 but absent from the UI convergence handoff — it fell
    between two documents.
13. **Handoff carries two accepted v1 risks** (SESSION_STEP4_DESIGN): the
    quoted block is prefilled verbatim into another execution's
    operator-signed prompt (cross-agent prompt injection), and the
    "Handoff from X" chip is recognized from prose, not verified (label
    spoofing). Must be revisited before any autonomous/unmediated handoff —
    a named prerequisite of the persistent-agents step in D6.
14. **Managed-agent ↔ session convergence, concrete order** (SESSION_PATH):
    managed agents *into* sessions first via lane mention (no new wire
    concepts), then session executions *into* managed agents via `agentRef`
    (needs delegation grammar). D6 references the topic only abstractly.

## 3. Next

The four rehydration defects (1–4) are one subsystem and one coherent bite.
Then 5–6 to make multi-member testing self-service. P1 whenever an hour
exists. Longer horizon lives in the research report §7: relay-durable
checkpoints (kind 44231) and encrypted native-snapshot sync (44232).

## 4. Authorities — unchanged, read when the question is "why"

| Document | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `SESSION_VISION.md` | Product authority: the ten invariants |
| `SESSION_DESIGN_PHASE_PLAN.md` | Design authority: D1–D6, gates G1–G7 |
| `SESSION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` | Execution contract + rulings R1–R28 |
| `FABLE_SESSION_CONTINUITY_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` | Continuity investigation, taxonomy, design space, addenda A–C |
| `P1_JUDGE_SCRIPT.md`, `P1_CONTINUITY_MATRIX.md` | The G1 experiment |
| `CODING_SESSION_UI_CONVERGENCE_HANDOFF.md` | UI convergence slices 2–4 (open) |
| `SESSION_PHASE_HANDOFF_2026-08-18.md` | Ship record + Andy's runbook |

`coding-session-analysis.md` is **not** history — it is the evergreen how-to
for querying stored session data (CLI + SQL). Its kind table stops at 44225
and needs updating for genesis/goal/authority/name/closure kinds.

History lives in `docs/archive/` (eight documents, moved 2026-08-18). Their
load-bearing content is extracted into §2 items 9–14 above; the rest is
provenance. Brian's working agreements moved from
`archive/SESSION_HANDOFF_SOL.md` §10 into `AGENTS.md`.

## 5. The rule that keeps this from becoming the nineteenth document

A finding from live use lands **here**, in §2, the day it is found — not in a
new document. New documents are for authorities and experiment protocols
only. When this file's §2 empties into shipped work, it shrinks; it is not an
append-only log.

**Note the irony deliberately:** this file is a hand-maintained ledger of
goals, decisions, open threads, and next steps — exactly the structure the
checkpoint design (report Addendum A) proposes storing as signed session
facts. Buzz should eventually hold this state itself, and this workflow is
its first customer.
